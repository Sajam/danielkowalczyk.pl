Frontend for my personal website.


Possibly reusable and interesting components that maybe you can use:
  * CodeListing - now just plain-text view with line numbering, basic version for further enhancements.
  * Small SCSS/CSS components that are easy to adjust for any page:
    * centered/standardShadow mixin,
    * language-switcher widget - list menu expanded after hover for switching language pure in CSS),
      need proper flag icons (personally I'm using these: http://lipis.github.io/flag-icon-css/),
    * older-newer-pagination - styles for creating typical blog navigation (plus page numbers info).
